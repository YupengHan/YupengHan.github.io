<h1><BIG>M</BIG><small>OTIVATION</small></h1>
Predicting an object's pose is an important topic of robot vision, which has important value in automated warehouses.
<br>Current mainstream object detection and location approaches rely on neural networks, which may have the following problems:</br>
<ul>
  <li><p>[1] For each new scenario, a corresponding training data set needs to be established (Which could be expensive, especially for 6DOF pose labeling).</p></li>
  <li><p>[2] When there is a change in the scene (Eg: the light becomes stronger), it is necessary to re-establish the data set and train a new neural network.</p></li>
</ul>

    The dress is a photograph that <br/>
    became a viral internet sensation <br/>
    on 26 February 2015,<br/>
    when viewers disagreed over <br/>
    whether the dress pictured was <br/>
    coloured black and royal blue,<br/>
    or white and gold.<br/>

<br />
I revisited the way neural networks recognize objects.<br />
<ul>
  <li><p>[1] Color information, provided by RGB images and label data.</p></li>
  <li><p>[2] Pattern information, that is, the surface texture information of the object of interest.</p></li>
</ul>
  
  
  
In my opinion, the reason why the current mainstream object recognition algorithms lack portability is that <br />
<b>There is no one-to-one correspondence between the RGB color information and the actual Hue of the object.</b><br />
<br />
Human recognition of objects may also be through two steps, color and pattern. It is worth noting that <br />
<b>human do not directly use RGB information but use the brain to process RGB information.</b> <br />
<br />
Through further understanding, I found that the colors we usually talk about can be divided into hue, saturation, and luminance. <br />
Interestingly, in different luminance situations, different hues may show the same RGB. <br />
That is, the RGB information does not have a one-to-one correspondence with the original color of the object. <br />
This has a major impact on neural networks. If we are in an environment where the light intensity is A, <br />
collect data and train CNN. When the test environment light intensity B and A are very different, we can hardly expect CNN to have the same accuracy as in the past.

<!-- Proposed Approach -->
<h1><BIG>P</BIG><small>ROPOSED</small> <BIG>A</BIG><small>PPROACH</small></h1>



In order to solve the above-mentioned problems, we propose an object detection method based on RGB-D data and object 3D model.
<ul>
  <li><p>Our method first rendering different object poses in the scene, comparing the rendered synthesis point cloud with the collected observed point cloud, and selecting the most similar pose as the predict pose.</p></li>
  <li><p>Unlike other learning-based approaches, it does not require a training process. For new scenes, we can scan the object through the RGB-D sensor to build new 3D model of the object under the new lighting condition.</p></li>
  <li><p>For light-stable scenes (EG: warehouses), this type of method is quick and easy to implement.</p></li>
</ul>

<li><p>Solved the difficulty of service seekers when faced with a large number of service providers, also addressed the drawbacks of the First In First Out (FIFO) matching mechanism by developed a stable matching system based on utility theory to generate the preference lists of service providers and service seekers. The matching mechanism was accomplished based on different utility interests. Searched for the optimal matching frequency using the provided matching.</p></li>
<!-- <li><p>Implemented the matching algorithm based on MATLAB and simulated service seekers arrive as a Poisson process with a fixed number of service providers offering resources. The service providers could only serve for one service seekers at one time.</p></li> -->

<li><p>Re-accomplished the Ego-splitting framework in Julia. The new framework could handle a large graph (millions of edges) within a few (less than 10) minutes.</p>

<li><p>Demo of how Ego-splitting works, nodes stands for people, and edges stands for relationship. Nodes #1 is Yupeng HAN, nodes #2, #3, #4 are Yupeng's shoolmates, nodes #8, #9, #10 are Yupeng's co-workers and nodes #5, #6, #7 are Yupeng's family members. To better analysis the social network, we can divide Yupeng in to three nodes, #1, #11, #12 to represent Yupeng's working, studying, home characters. Following are the demo and the result of the efficiency. </p>
