I received my M.Sc degree in ME from [https://engineering.purdue.edu/ME Purdue University, West Lafayette] with a strong GPA of *3.96*/4.00, and B.Sc degree in [http://en.sjtu.edu.cn *Tsien Hsue-Shen Honor Program*, SJTU] in Dec 2018 and Jun 2017, respectively. After graduation, I worked as an Intern computer vision algorithm engineer to explore efficient human face detection algorithms on depth images at [http://www.deptrum.com/index_en.html Deptrum]. Then I came to MVIG work on 2D and 3D feature fusion under the supervision of [https://scholar.google.com.hk/citations?user=QZVQEWAAAAAJ&hl=zh-CN Prof. *Cewu LU*].


- Notice the edge of 3D information in industrial application and sensing the quick revolution of the 3D perception sensor in the near future, I began to have a considerable interest in how to better use the advantage of 3D features. So I joined Machine Vision Intelligence Group in SJTU as a research assistant to explore the method of fusion 2D image features with 3D point cloud information.
- Facing the challenge of using a single model makes 3D detection in multi-scale objects. Generated ideas, to strengthen 3D point cloud extracted features by utilizing 2D RGB extracted features and dynamic anchor boxes' size determined by 2D images.
- Built the pipeline of the fusion network, including extracting different features from point clouds and RGB images, transforming 2D information to 3D proposal boxes, crop key points and their 3D features inside the proposal boxes, concatenating 3D features with 2D features, and post-processing.(on going, demo will coming soon)

- With the development of deep learning in computer vision and the widespread of low-cost depth sensors like structure light and TOF cameras, we can get 3D information as easy as taking a photo in the year 2000. Though current 3D images are not perfect, such as their sparse, intensive geometry, relatively expensive when used over long distances (Lidar). We can always use the current low-cost 3D information to do a lot of things we can't do before. One of the most popular usages is to utilize more detail human face 3D features to identify the payer's face and perform the payment in the vending machine.
- To satisfy the need of automatic human face detection on low power cost and low computational power single chip microcomputer. I independently implement a modified version of the multi-task cascade CNN model based on Caffe and python from scripts. The model solved the problem of face detection on completed depth images. I also Optimize the model to obtain 99.93\% precision and over 98\% recall.
